# Praise Monero!

Classic comic page that puts the photo of our great, all-powerful king FluffyPony in front of Monero.How,
a website with many resources about Monero.

The original website was praisemonero.org, but it's been offline for a long time (it's a scammy site now) so
I saved its source code for possible future use. I am not the creator of this source code although I have made
some minor modifications.

I'm also hosting an alternative version on the [Monero Brasil](https://monero.inf.br/aleluia/) news portal.

If you really want to send me donations, send to the Monero Brasil funds: 87GA2r9km8j7P63q6DEUygCi4JjrjvYcbXhi479fgWdoLbtxcqsSJ92SCfaf7ZVtwP9axyvYmSp9iHaeP72SGViz18dKfL3
